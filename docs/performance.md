## Performance

### As a Service, I should: 
- Always have a baseline set of metrics of my isolated service
- Understand what those metrics need to be for each functionality i.e. how long file uploads should take vs a generic GET request
- Make sure the baseline does not include any other components i.e. networks, infrastructure etc.
- Expose a set of metrics, see [Metrics](github.com/ukhomeoffice/monitoring_metrics.md)
- Make performance testing part of my Continuous Integration workflow
- Have a history of performance over time
